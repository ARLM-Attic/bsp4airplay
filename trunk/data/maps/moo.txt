Moo!  This map is designed for a low person multiplier game in Quake2
.I dislike games where there are 3 or 4 people and it takes days to 
find anyone to frag. This map also works in single player mode.
I added some critters for giggles. 
Put the Moo.bsp into your Quake2/basq2/maps folder.
Then you launch Quake2 and bring down the console by hitting the "~" key.
Type in "map Moo" (without the quotes) and you are rocking.
Have fun, and remember Quake is reality and life is a game you buy 
at Wall Mart.
